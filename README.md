# Spring AOP

## 1. What is Spring AOP?
Spring AOP enables Aspect-Oriented Programming in spring applications. In AOP, aspects enable the modularization of concerns such as transaction management, logging or security that cut across multiple types and objects (often termed **crosscutting concerns**).

AOP provides the way to dynamically add the cross-cutting concern before, after or around the actual logic using simple pluggable configurations. It makes easy to maintain code in the present and future as well. You can add/remove concerns without recompiling complete sourcecode simply by changing configuration files (if you are applying aspects suing XML configuration).
